//        ========  BINARY SEARCH TREE ========

/* A tree data structure is a way to hold data, which visualized looks like an actual tree, but upside down :D. The data points in the tree are called Nodes. The top one is called the root node. A node with branches leading to other nodes are called parent nodes. Leaf nodes are the nodes */
